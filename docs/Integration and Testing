Test flows
	1Win1Lose flow and incorrect surrender/retreat:
		searchOpponent A
		searchOpponent B
		getMap A
		getMap B
		(The map id should be the same)
		commitPath A
		commitPath B (use more resources)
		retreat A fails
		revealPath A
		revealPath B
		(At this point, B state should be 5, A should be 6)
		surrender A fails
		postGameCleanUp A
		postGameCleanUp B
		(Confirm nothing is left)
		(Confirm A is burnt, confirm B level is 1.5)

	1Win1Surrender flow:
		searchOpponent B
		searchOpponent C
		getMap B
		getMap C
		(The map id should be the same)
		commitPath B
		commitPath C
		surrender B
		(At this point, B state should be 6, C should be 5)
		postGameCleanUp B
		postGameCleanUp C
		(Confirm nothing is left)
		(Confirm B is burnt, confirm C level is 1.5)

	1Win1Retreat flow:
		searchOpponent C
		searchOpponent D
		getMap C
		getMap D
		(The map id should be the same)
		retreat D
		(At this point, D state should be 7, C should be 5)
		postGameCleanUp D
		postGameCleanUp C
		(Confirm nothing is left for C, confirm the tank is intact for D)
		(Confirm D is burnt, although the tank is still here, confirm C level is 2)

	"Draw" flow and withdraw:
		searchOpponent E
		searchOpponent C
		withdrawFromQueue E
		searchOpponent E
		searchOpponent F
		getMap E
		getMap F
		(The map id should be the same)
		commitPath F
		commitPath E (use same resources)
		revealPath E
		revealPath F
		(At this point, F state should be 5, E should be 6)
		postGameCleanUp E
		postGameCleanUp F
		(Confirm nothing is left)
		(Confirm E is burnt, confirm F level is 1.5)

	Timeout flow and incorrect states:
		getMap E fails
		withdrawFromQueue E fails
		commitPath E fails
		revealPath E fails
		postGameCleanup E fails
